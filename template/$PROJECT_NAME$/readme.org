#+title: <%= @project_name_camel_case %>


First you need to install everything, inside your project:

#+begin_src shell :exports both :results output 
  mix deps.get
  npm i # yes, of course you must have npm installed
#+end_src

Then

#+begin_src shell :exports both :results output 
  mix watch.compile # this will open your project on the port on config.exs
  # this will watch your elixir files for changes and then compile.
  # might get slow if your project gets too big... in this case you can run the `mix compile` manually and only run the frontend with `npm run dev`
#+end_src

Unfortunatelly, when you kill the =watch.compile= it does not kill the frontend project, to do that you can use =mix port.kill=.


The frontend project will execute the function = =<%= @project_name_camel_case %>.main()=

You can add the styles in =styles/main.scss=

All html files in =html/=.

If you need to add extra JS, check =js/index.js=.
